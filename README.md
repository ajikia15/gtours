# gtours - Your Next Adventure Awaits!

Welcome to `gtours`, a modern web application designed to showcase exciting travel destinations and tour packages.

## ðŸš€ Powered By

This project leverages a powerful stack to deliver a fast, scalable, and maintainable application:

- **Next.js 15 (App Router):** Utilizing the latest features for efficient routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering. I've embraced the **App Router** architecture and implemented **server components** where appropriate to optimize performance and reduce client-side JavaScript.
- **next-intl:** Comprehensive internationalization (i18n) integration, managing locale-based routing and content translation (e.g., English, Georgian, Russian) for a truly global user experience.
- **Firebase:** Employed as a robust baaS for data storage (Firestore), user authentication, and image hosting (Firebase Storage).
- **TypeScript:** Ensuring code quality, type safety, and developer productivity across the entire codebase.
- **React Simple Maps:** For displaying interactive and engaging maps of tour locations.
- **React Markdown:** To render rich text descriptions for tours, allowing for formatted content.

## âœ¨ Key Highlights

- **Modern Architecture:** Built with Next.js 15's App Router for a highly performant and maintainable structure.
- **Comprehensive Internationalization:** Extensive localization support with `next-intl`, providing tour details and UI elements in multiple languages (EN, GE, RU).
- **Rich Tour Management & Admin Dashboard:** Features a dedicated admin section for creating, editing (with Markdown support), and managing tour information, including details like pricing, duration, and status.
- **Interactive Maps:** Utilizes `react-simple-maps` to visually represent tour locations, enhancing user engagement.
- **User Authentication:** Secure authentication flow allowing users to register and log in, including options like "Continue with Google."
- **Multi-Image Uploads:** Integrated solution for uploading and managing multiple images for each tour, hosted on Firebase Storage.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Demonstrates proficiency in both frontend (React, Next.js, TypeScript) and backend integration (Firebase Firestore & Storage).
- **Scalable & Maintainable Code:** Written in TypeScript with a focus on clean code, best practices, and clear separation of concerns.

Dive into the codebase to see how these technologies integrate to power a dynamic tour management platform, from user authentication and multi-language support to interactive maps and rich content display.
